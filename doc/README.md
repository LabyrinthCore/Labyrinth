Labyrinth Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Labyrinth Core is the original Labyrinth client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Labyrinth transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Labyrinth Core, visit [labyrinthcore.com](https://labyrinthcore.com/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Labyrinth Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/labyrinth-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/labyrinthd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run labyrinth-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Labyrinth Core to your applications folder, and then run Labyrinth Core.
